# Pygame_Plant_Sim
Week 2 of my personal challenge to write 1 program a week in the month of October. This is a plant simulator made with Python 3.

The current build has no original visual assests, this is next on the list.

Currently, the game functions in the most basic sense: you water the tree or wait. 
If you last 60 days without the plant dying you get the "win" screen. 
If you over or under water the plant too much you get the lose screen.

Lots to be added and refined over the next 5 days.
